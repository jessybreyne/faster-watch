## Introduction

The history of horology is rich and varied, with numerous developments and innovations over the centuries. Among these innovations are the 12h and 24h formats for measuring time. In this article, we will explore the history of these two formats in horology and examine why the 12h format is more popular today.

## History of the 12h Format

The 12h format, also known as the duodecimal time system, is the most commonly used system for measuring time in many parts of the world. It divides the day into two periods of 12 hours each, with hours labeled from 1 to 12 for each period.

The use of the 12h format dates back to ancient Egypt, where sundials divided the day into 12 daylight hours and 12 nighttime hours. Mechanical clocks later adopted this system for measuring time, particularly in Europe, where it became the standard.

## History of the 24h Format and Ancient Clocks

The 24h format, also called military time or international time, is a time system that divides the day into 24 hours, numbered from 0 to 23. This system is commonly used by the military, transportation services, and other industries where precision and clarity are essential.

Although it is often credited to Sir Sandford Fleming, a Canadian engineer, in the 19th century, examples of 24-hour clocks date back far earlier than this time. For example, Chartres Cathedral in France has a 24-hour clock inside and another outside. These clocks date back to the 14th century and are among the earliest known 24-hour clocks.

The Prague Astronomical Clock, built in 1410, is another example of a 24-hour clock. This complex and beautifully adorned clock not only displays the hours but also the positions of the planets, moon phases, and other astronomical information. This is further evidence that the use of the 24h format in horology goes back several centuries.

## Why is the 12h Format More Popular Today?

The 12h format is more popular than the 24h format for several reasons:

1. **Familiarity**: The 12h format is more familiar to many people, as it is commonly used in clocks, watches, and other timekeeping devices. This makes reading the time easier for most people.
2. **Simplicity**: The 12h format is often considered simpler than the 24h format, as it requires fewer digits to represent the hours. This makes the time easier to read and understand, especially for children and those learning to tell time for the first time.
3. **Cultural preferences**: The 12h format is more commonly used in Western countries, while the 24h format is more common in non-Western countries. This may influence the popularity of the 12h format, as it is seen as more "Western" and thus more familiar to many people.
4. **Technical compatibility**: The 12h format has a technical advantage over the 24h format in terms of hour and minute indexing. This is because the number 60, which represents minutes, is divisible by 12. This allows for the same indexes to be used for both hours and minutes on a 12h clock, making reading the time easier. On a 24h clock, however, this is not possible, as 60 is not divisible by 24.

In summary, the 12h format is more popular due to its familiarity, simplicity, cultural preferences, and technical compatibility with hour and minute indexing. However, it is important to note that the choice between 12h and 24h formats often depends on individual preferences and specific requirements in certain industries.
