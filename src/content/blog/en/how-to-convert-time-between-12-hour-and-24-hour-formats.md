## Introduction

Being able to convert time between the 12-hour and 24-hour formats is an essential skill, especially when dealing with international communication or transportation. In this article, we will guide you through the process of converting time between these two formats, with simple steps and examples.

## Converting 12-Hour to 24-Hour Format

To convert a time from the 12-hour format to the 24-hour format, follow these steps:

1. If the time is in AM, and the hour is already a two-digit number (i.e., 10, 11, or 12), leave the hour as-is.
2. If the time is in AM and the hour is a single-digit number (i.e., 1 to 9), add a leading zero to the hour (e.g., 05:30).
3. If the time is in PM and the hour is 12, leave the hour as-is.
4. If the time is in PM and the hour is between 1 and 11, add 12 to the hour (e.g., 2:45 PM becomes 14:45).

## Converting 24-Hour to 12-Hour Format

To convert a time from the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format, follow these steps:

1. If the hour is 00, change it to 12 and add the "AM" suffix (e.g., 00:15 becomes 12:15 AM).
2. If the hour is between 01 and 11, add the "AM" suffix (e.g., 09:30 becomes 9:30 AM).
3. If the hour is 12, add the "PM" suffix (e.g., 12:00 becomes 12:00 PM).
4. If the hour is between 13 and 23, subtract 12 from the hour and add the "PM" suffix (e.g., 16:20 becomes 4:20 PM).

## Examples

Here are a few examples of converting time between the 12-hour and 24-hour formats:

- 12-Hour to 24-Hour:
  - 8:15 AM -> 08:15
  - 12:45 PM -> 12:45
